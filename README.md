Sentiment  Analysisis  a  branch  of  Natural  Language  Processing  (NLP)  that  allows  us  to  determinealgorithmically whether a statement or document is “positive” or “negative”.Sentiment analysis is a technology of increasing importance in the modern society as it allows individuals and organizations to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media content. Keeping abreast of  socio-political  developments  is  especially  important  during  periods  of  policy  shifts  such  as  election years,  when  both  electoral  candidates  and  companies  can  benefit  from  sentiment  analysis  by  making appropriate changes to their campaigning and business strategies respectively.

Our goal was to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to the 2020 US Election from August 27th to October 28th to learn who was the more "popular" presidential candidate on Twitter, which candidate has the most open supporters on Twitter, and how has the sentiment towards each candidate changed over the past two months. We also created a word cloud on the most popular words associated with each candidate. 

We also discovered all the QAnon tweets. Since many QAnon supporters try to "game" the Twitter algorithm by using positive and "non-toxic" keywords to avoid their Tweets being taken down, we decided to analyze if these tweets have a higher or lower sentiment score. We also created a word cloud on the most popular words used in QAnon tweets.
